Compile all the class files
Run the Pilot file:
It will ask for-------
	Name of relation
	List of attributes: Enter them in a single line space-separated. (They will all be converted into uppercase)
	Number of Functional dependencies: Enter an integer
	Functional Dependencies: Enter the function dependencies in the following format-
		{B}->{E} if B determines Enter
		{A,B}->{C,D} if A and B together determine C and Database
		
		Functional Dependencies will be decomposed if possible.
		NOTE::::::: if an FD contains no new atomic dependencies, the count of FDs entered will not increased.

### Commit Message Guidelines

The commit message:

- is written in the imperative (e.g., "Fix ...", "Add ...")
- is kept short, while concisely explaining what the commit does.
- is clear about what part of the code is affected -- often by prefixing with the name of the subsystem and a colon, like "server: ..." or "docs: ...".
- is a complete sentence, ending with a period.
